# Network Handler

I wrote this because I found myself repeating a lot of boilerplate code when sending and receiving data with APIs. I'll fill out the details another time.

### Features
This essentially reduces the boilerplate you need to deal with when you make an HTTP network request.

### Todo
* Readme
	* show before and after code examples
	* demo task as return value and cancelling
	* demo mocking data
* create request struct
